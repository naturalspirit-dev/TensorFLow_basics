# TensorFlow_Basics

* Basic TensorFlow operations.
* Creating own opetration classes to mimic TensorFlow mechanics.
* Building simple single and multi-layer perceptrons using Numpy arrays and marices.
* Basic convolutional networks using TensorFlow
* Basic recurrent neural networks using TensorFlow
* Google colab Notebooks (based on the ***["Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/info)*** course from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on the **[fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)**
